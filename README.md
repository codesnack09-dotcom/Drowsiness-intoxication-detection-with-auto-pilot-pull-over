# Driver Monitoring & Auto-Pilot Simulation

This project simulates a **driver monitoring system** with **automatic pilot assist**.  
It uses OpenCV to detect drowsiness (closed eyes) or random alcohol influence, and engages a simulated autopilot that "pulls the car over safely".

## Features
- Detects driver's eyes (open/closed) using OpenCV.
- Triggers drowsiness detection if eyes remain closed for more than 5 seconds.
- Randomly simulates alcohol impairment.
- Engages "autopilot mode" (slows down, finds roadside spot, pulls over).
- Runs on webcam for live testing.

## 🔹 Simulation Features:
- Camera/Webcam → used to detect face & driver’s eyes.
- If eyes are closed > 5 seconds → system assumes drowsy.
- There’s a random event (10%) to simulate alcohol detection.
- When detected → autopilot activates, simulating a pull-over with step-by-step printed logs.
- Drowsiness detection (PERCLOS, EAR, yawning) from the camera using MediaPipe Face Mesh.
- Optional reading of an alcohol sensor (e.g., MQ-3) via Serial from a microcontroller (Arduino).
- Autopilot state machine that “pulls over” in the simulation (using Pygame) when the driver is unsafe.
- Can be stopped by pressing q.

## ⚠️ Warning
- This is a simulation (not a real system for cars).
- For real implementation you would need: 
- Camera + AI (face/eyelid detection)
- Alcohol sensor
- Hand pressure sensor on steering wheel
- And a car control system, which is much more complex and very risky if directly applied.
- This project is for simulation and educational purposes only. It is NOT a real self-driving or safety system. Do not use it in actual vehicles.

## Technical Challenges
- Accurate detection of drowsiness/intoxication requires a combination of camera sensors (eye-tracking), physiological sensors (heart rate, steering wheel grip), and AI.
- A real autopilot is not just about coding Arduino, but requires integration into the drive-by-wire system, GPS, LIDAR, cameras, and vehicle control systems.
- Safety aspects are highly critical (misdetection must not occur, as it can be dangerous).

## Potential Step-by-Step Realization
- Can start with a simple simulation (like the Python code I created).
- The next level could be building a small hardware prototype: Arduino/Raspberry Pi + DHT/IR/accelerometer sensor + relay/servo motor module.
- Advanced stage → integration with a real car (requires collaboration with automotive engineers).

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
