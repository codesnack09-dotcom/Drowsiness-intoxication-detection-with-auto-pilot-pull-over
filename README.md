# Driver Monitoring & Auto-Pilot Simulation

This project simulates a **driver monitoring system** with **automatic pilot assist**.  
It uses OpenCV to detect drowsiness (closed eyes) or random alcohol influence, and engages a simulated autopilot that "pulls the car over safely".

## Features
- Detects driver's eyes (open/closed) using OpenCV.
- Triggers drowsiness detection if eyes remain closed for more than 5 seconds.
- Randomly simulates alcohol impairment.
- Engages "autopilot mode" (slows down, finds roadside spot, pulls over).
- Runs on webcam for live testing.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py

#üîπ Simulation Features:
‚Ä¢ Camera/Webcam ‚Üí used to detect face & driver‚Äôs eyes.
‚Ä¢ If eyes are closed > 5 seconds ‚Üí system assumes drowsy.
‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs a random event (10%) to simulate alcohol detection.
‚Ä¢ When detected ‚Üí autopilot activates, simulating a pull-over with step-by-step printed logs.
‚Ä¢ Can be stopped by pressing q.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
‚Ä¢ This is a simulation (not a real system for cars).
‚Ä¢ For real implementation you would need: 
‚Ä¢ Camera + AI (face/eyelid detection)
‚Ä¢ Alcohol sensor
‚Ä¢ Hand pressure sensor on steering wheel
‚Ä¢ And a car control system, which is much more complex and very risky if directly applied.
‚Ä¢ This project is for simulation and educational purposes only. It is NOT a real self-driving or safety system. Do not use it in actual vehicles.

## Technical Challenges
‚Ä¢ Accurate detection of drowsiness/intoxication requires a combination of camera sensors (eye-tracking), physiological sensors (heart rate, steering wheel grip), and AI.
‚Ä¢ A real autopilot is not just about coding Arduino, but requires integration into the drive-by-wire system, GPS, LIDAR, cameras, and vehicle control systems.
‚Ä¢ Safety aspects are highly critical (misdetection must not occur, as it can be dangerous).

## Potential Step-by-Step Realization
‚Ä¢ Can start with a simple simulation (like the Python code I created).
‚Ä¢ The next level could be building a small hardware prototype: Arduino/Raspberry Pi + DHT/IR/accelerometer sensor + relay/servo motor module.
‚Ä¢ Advanced stage ‚Üí integration with a real car (requires collaboration with automotive engineers).
