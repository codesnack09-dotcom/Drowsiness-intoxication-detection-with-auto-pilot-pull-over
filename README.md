# Driver Drowsiness & Autopilot System

This project simulates a system that detects if a driver is **drowsy** or **intoxicated** and automatically activates an **autopilot mode** to safely pull the car over.

## Features
- Drowsiness detection (camera/eye-tracking simulation)
- Alcohol/health sensor simulation
- Steering behavior monitoring
- Autopilot navigation to roadside

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
